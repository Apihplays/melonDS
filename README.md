DS emulator, sorta

The goal is to do things right and fast, akin to blargSNES (but hopefully better). But also to, you know, have a fun challenge :)
<hr>

## How to use

Firmware boot (not direct boot) requires a BIOS/firmware dump from an original DS or DS Lite.
DS firmwares dumped from a DSi or 3DS aren't bootable and only contain configuration data, thus they are only suitable when booting games directly.

### Possible firmware sizes

 * 128KB: DSi/3DS DS-mode firmware (reduced size due to lacking bootcode)
 * 256KB: regular DS firmware
 * 512KB: iQue DS firmware

DS BIOS dumps from a DSi or 3DS can be used with no compatibility issues. DSi BIOS dumps (in DSi mode) are not compatible. Or maybe they are. I don't know.

As for the rest, the interface should be pretty straightforward. If you have a question, don't hesitate to ask, though!

## How to build
See [BUILD.md](./BUILD.md) for build instructions.

## Google Drive save sync

melonDS can optionally synchronize DS game save files (.sav) with your Google Drive, letting you
continue your progress on another computer. When enabled, the latest save is downloaded when a
game boots, and uploaded after each in-game save. Files are stored in a `melonDS` folder in your
Drive (the app can only access files it created itself).

If both the local and cloud copies changed since the last sync (for example, you played on two
devices without syncing), melonDS asks which version to keep: local, cloud, or both (the cloud
copy is preserved next to your save with a `.conflict` suffix).

This feature is enabled by default and controlled by the CMake option `ENABLE_GOOGLE_DRIVE_SYNC`.

### Setup

1. In the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a project (or pick an
   existing one) and enable the **Google Drive API**.
2. Under *APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen*, configure the consent screen (External is fine
   for personal use) and add yourself as a test user.
3. Under *APIs & Services → Credentials*, create an **OAuth client ID** of type **Desktop app**.
4. Paste the client ID and secret into your `melonDS.toml`:

   ```toml
   [CloudSync]
   ClientID = "1234567890-abc.apps.googleusercontent.com"
   ClientSecret = "GOCSPX-..."
   ```

   or paste them into the `kDefaultClientID` / `kDefaultClientSecret` constants in
   `src/frontend/qt_sdl/CloudSyncManager.cpp` and rebuild.
5. In melonDS: *Config → Interface settings → Google Drive → Sign in…*, then tick
   *Sync saves with Google Drive* and press OK. A **Sync Now** button is available for manual
   synchronization.

Tokens are stored locally in `cloudsync.json` next to the melonDS config (permissions restricted
on POSIX systems). Note that the OAuth client secret of a "Desktop app" client is not treated as
confidential by Google; only sync saves with Drive accounts you trust.

## TODO LIST

 * better DSi emulation
 * better OpenGL rendering
 * netplay
 * the impossible quest of pixel-perfect 3D graphics
 * support for rendering screens to separate windows
 * emulating some fancy addons
 * other non-core shit (debugger, graphics viewers, etc)

### TODO LIST FOR LATER (low priority)

 * big-endian compatibility (Wii, etc)
 * LCD refresh time (used by some games for blending effects)
 * any feature you can eventually ask for that isn't outright stupid

## Credits

 * Martin for GBAtek, a good piece of documentation
 * Cydrak for the extra 3D GPU research
 * limittox for the icon
 * All of you comrades who have been testing melonDS, reporting issues, suggesting shit, etc
